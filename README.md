# RecMeGPT

## Overview
RecMeGPTs delivers you media recommendations in response to your input! How many times have you played a videogame, watched a movie or show, read a book, listened to an album and kept an itch for more things based on the media, art and entertainment you just loved? I know I have! I watched 'Oppenheimer' and I loved it and went on a 3-week journey to read about the history of nuclear energy. That's the power good art can have on you. With that in mind, I channeled the power of ChatGPT to recommend videogames, music albums, films, TV shows and books based on the input of the user, with useful links to learn more about them.
It doesn't stop with entertainment, you can enter a theme or descriptor, something like 'Optimism' or 'Melancholy' and it will give you recommendations with that theme. So enjoy!
